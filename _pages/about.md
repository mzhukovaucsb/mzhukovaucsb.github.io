Hello! I’m Marina, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and a OneReach.ai Academic Fellow. My research and work spans around emojis, generative AI, customer research, and human-AI interaction. I recently completed a certificate in Technology Management from UCSB’s College of Engineering, further bridging the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical application 🎓💡

I've had the opportunity to participate in Google’s Computer Science Research Mentorship Program, PhD Fellowship Summit, and Product Inclusion & Equity Summit. My hands-on experience includes three internships at Amazon Alexa, where I contributed to the Artificial General Intelligence team and won the Amazon Alexa Prize SocialBot Grand Challenge 5 as part of the GauchoChat team. 🏆🤖

My goal is to leverage my expertise in generative AI and customer insights to drive innovation and deliver impactful solutions. 🌍✨

I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities starting June 2025 in LA, the Bay Area, or SF.

When I’m not immersed in technology, you’ll find me enjoying the outdoors — whether hiking, running, or playing beach volleyball. 

Let’s connect and explore how I can contribute to your team! 🌄
