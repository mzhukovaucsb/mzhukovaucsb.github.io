I’m a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara, with a focus on digital communication and human-AI interaction. I recently earned a Technology Management certificate from UCSB’s College of Engineering. 🎓💡

🤖 ex-Amazon: I completed three internships within Amazon’s Artificial General Intelligence (Amazon AGI, Alexa) and won the Amazon Alexa Prize SocialBot Grand Challenge 5 as a part of GauchoChat team. 🏆🤖

🔍 Google Fellow: I participated in multiple events organized by Google: I attended Research@NYC (Google Research), completed Computer Science Research Mentorship Program (Google Research), attended PhD Fellowship Summit (Google Research), and attended Product Inclusion & Equity Summit.

I’m passionate about leveraging my expertise in language, generative AI, and customer research to drive innovation and create meaningful, impactful solutions!

**I’m currently seeking full-time opportunities starting July 1, 2025 in Los Angeles, Bay Area, or San Francisco.**
