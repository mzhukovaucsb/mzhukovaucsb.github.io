🧠 I design how frontier AI models behave.

👩🏼‍💻 I'm a Member of Model Design Staff on <a href="https://microsoft.ai"> Microsoft AI </a> Superintelligence Team, working on model behavior and AI personality for Microsoft Copilot and our in-house foundation models. I hold a Ph.D. in Linguistics from UC Santa Barbara. I am based in San Francisco.

🔬 My background spans linguistics, human-AI interaction, and large language models, with deep expertise in mixed-methods research.

🏆 Before Microsoft, I completed three internships at Amazon AGI and won the Amazon Alexa Prize SocialBot Grand Challenge 5 with the GauchoChat team. I've also been selected for several competitive Google Research programs — including Research@NYC, the CS Research Mentorship Program, the Ph.D. Fellowship Summit, and the Product Inclusion & Equity Summit.
