🎓 I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on digital communication, human-AI interaction, and inclusive language. I recently earned a Technology Management certificate from UCSB’s College of Engineering. 

🤖 ex-Amazon: I completed 3 internships at Amazon AGI and won the Amazon Alexa Prize SocialBot Grand Challenge 5 as a part of GauchoChat team. 

🔍 Google Fellow: I was selected to attend several Google & Google Research events: Research@NYC, Computer Science Research Mentorship Program, PhD Fellowship Summit, Product Inclusion & Equity Summit.
