I am a third-year Linguistics Ph.D. student, currently pursuing a Graduate Program in Management Practice Certificate, at the University of California, Santa Barbara. I primarily work with Professor Simon Todd (CPLS Lab) and Professor Lal Zimman (TRILL Lab). My research focuses on conversational AI, computational social science, and sociocultural linguistics, with an emphasis on the role of emoji in digital communication. 

I am a current Google's Computer Science Research Mentorship Program Scholar (2023a cohort). I have spent Summer'22 as a Knowledge Engineer Intern at Amazon Alexa AI and will be returning to Amazon for Summer'23. This year, I participate at the Amazon Alexa Prize SocialBot Grand Challenge 5 as a part of GauchoChat team. 

**I am seeking a research-focused industry internship for Summer'24 in NYC.
