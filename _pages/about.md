👩🏼‍💻 I’m a mixed-methods researcher specializing in human-AI interaction, large language models, and digital communication, with a strong background in both qualitative and quantitative research methods. 

🤖 I completed three internships at Amazon AGI and won the Amazon Alexa Prize SocialBot Grand Challenge 5 as part of the GauchoChat team. I was also selected to attend several Google & Google Research events, including Research@NYC, the Computer Science Research Mentorship Program, the Ph.D. Fellowship Summit, and the Product Inclusion & Equity Summit.

💡 I am dedicated to leveraging my expertise in language, generative AI, and user-centered research to drive impactful innovations in AI technologies. My goal is to contribute to the development of next-generation AI systems that are transparent, inclusive, and capable of fostering meaningful human-AI interactions.
