I am a fourth-year Ph.D student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of California, Santa Barbara and a current OneReach.ai Academic Fellow. I primarily work with Professor Simon Todd (CPLS Lab), Professor Lal Zimman (TRILL Lab), and Professor Laurel Brehm (PRPL Lab). I recently completed UCSB College of Engineering Graduate Program in Management Practice Certificate.  

I participated in Google's Computer Science Research Mentorship Program (2023a cohort), Google's PhD Fellowhip Summit and will be attending Google's Product Inclusion & Equity Summit in October 2023. I have spent Summer 2022 and Summer 2023 as a Knowledge Engineer Intern at Amazon Alexa AI. I also won the Amazon Alexa Prize SocialBot Grand Challenge 5 as part of the GauchoChat team.

I am skilled in Conversational AI, Research, and Product Management and committed to applying these skills to the advancement of innovative technologies. 

**I am currently looking for a Summer'24 Internship (remote/NYC/Bay Area/Seattle).**
